# Jarvis - Desktop Voice Assistant üéôÔ∏èüß†

This is the **enhanced version** of Jarvis ‚Äî a Python-powered desktop voice assistant that listens to your voice, understands your query, fetches a smart response using an **LLM (LLaMA 3 via Ollama)**, and speaks it back!

This is the **starter model**, and I plan to **upgrade it into a fully functional personal AI assistant** in the future.

## ‚ú® Features (Current Version)
- Greets the user based on the time of day
- Listens to your voice commands using your microphone
- Uses **Ollama LLaMA 3 model** to answer queries

- Listens continuously until you say **"exit"** or **"stop"**
