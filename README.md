# Jarvis - Basic Voice Assistant  🎙️🧠

This is the **basic version** of Jarvis, a Python-powered desktop voice assistant that can recognize your speech, fetch information, and talk back to you!  
This project is currently a **starting model**, and I plan to **enhance it into a fully functional, advanced Jarvis assistant** in the future.

## ✨ Features (Current Base Model)
